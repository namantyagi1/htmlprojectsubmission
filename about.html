            <h1>About Little Lemon</h1>
            <p>Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant located in the heart of Chicago, Illinois. Our restaurant is a culinary journey through the flavors of Italy, Greece, and Turkey, where traditional recipes meet a modern twist.</p>
            <p>Owned by brothers Mario and Adrian, Little Lemon was born out of their passion for Mediterranean cuisine and their dream of sharing it with the world. Mario, our talented chef, draws inspiration from his Italian roots and brings the authenticity of Italian flavors to every dish.</p>
            <p>Adrian, the marketing guru of the restaurant, is the driving force behind our expanding menu. He believes that the richness of Mediterranean cuisine goes beyond Italy, and he's constantly exploring new recipes and flavors to delight our customers.</p>
            <p>At Little Lemon, we offer a rotating menu of 12â€“15 carefully crafted items, adapting seasonally to bring you the freshest ingredients and flavors. Our rustic and relaxed atmosphere, combined with moderate prices, makes us the perfect destination for a delightful meal at any time of the day.</p>
